Information and findings regarding dating


## Intro

In the digital age where we increasingly acquire our needs like food, commodities and even social engagement online, it should be no surprise dating is also part of the online domain.
In real life, dating revolves around creating chemistry, shared emotional experiences and sexual tension. Are the rules of engagement the same for online dating?
This is an effort to explore the domain of online dating and how it might differ from offline.

## The basics

While their implementation might vary, dating apps revolve around a similar concept.
You create a profile with pictures of yourself, provide some additional information like age, education or interests, and write a short introduction. You get to see the profiles of other users, typically in a slideshow fashion, and get to "vote" whether you like the profile or not.
If both users vote yes on each others profile a match is made, and you can typically chat with each other. 

The differences between these apps is typically in the targeted demographic or the way profiles are set up. Where apps like Tinder and Hinge are primarily focused on the visual aspect, Badoo and Bumble are focused on the contents of the profiles.
## The good

Dating apps have vastly increased the scope of potential partners for their users.
3/10 Americans report having used dating apps and 1/10 Americans met their current partner (as in married) via dating apps.[^3] 

Besides increasing the scope of potential partners, dating apps also allow users to find partners based on special interests. Since the profiles provide users with (basic) information on personality, pre-selections can be made, hypothetically increasing the chances of finding a suitable match. 

Dating apps provides its users with a low risk environment for meeting new people, due to the apps serving as an intermediary. 

## The bad

On paper, dating apps increase its users chances of finding a match.
However, things like market saturation, perceived value and relentless algorithms can create discrepancies in experience. Below is a video simulating the average experience based on statistics:

Users also report other motivations than dating for using dating apps.
A 2023 survey among Tinder users showed that almost *half* of the respondents reported using dating apps for reasons other than finding partners. [^4]
